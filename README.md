# Machine Learning & Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains various machine learning and data analysis projects that demonstrate techniques across different domains such as customer segmentation, deep learning, recommendation systems, and more. Each project uses popular tools and libraries such as Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn to solve real-world problems.

## Projects

- **Advanced Customer Segmentation**  
  Segment customers using advanced clustering techniques to improve marketing strategies.

- **Deep Learning for Image and Signal Processing**  
  Analyze images and signals for tasks like object detection and aerial analysis.

- **Film Recommendation System**  
  Build a recommendation system using IMDB data and movie ratings.

- **Time Series Forecasting with LSTM**  
  Predict passenger counts using LSTM models for time series data.

- **Kaggle Data Analysis**  
  Analyze medical datasets to predict patient outcomes using machine learning techniques.

- **HR Department Salary Prediction**  
  Build a predictive model to estimate salaries based on employee data.

- **Outlier Detection with Python**  
  Identify outliers in datasets to improve data quality for analysis.
